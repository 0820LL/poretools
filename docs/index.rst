The MinION (TM) from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) is the first nanopore sequencer to be 
commercialised and is now available to early-access users. The MinION (TM) is a USB-connected, 
portable nanopore sequencer which permits real-time analysis of streaming event data. 
Currently, the research community lacks a standardized toolkit for the analysis of nanopore datasets.

We have therefore develped ``poretools``, a flexible toolkit for exploring datasets generated by 
nanopore sequencing devices from MinION for the purposes of quality control and downstream analysis. 
``Poretools`` operates directly on the native FAST5 (a variant of the HDF5 standard) file format produced 
by ONT and provides a wealth of format conversion utilities and data exploration and visualization tools. 
Below are a few examples.

1. Extract sequences in FASTQ format from a set of FAST5 files.
    
.. code-block:: bash

    poretools fastq fast5/
    poretools fastq --type fwd fast5/
    poretools fastq --type rev fast5/

2. Make a collector's curve of the yield from a sequencing run.

.. code-block:: bash

    poretools yield_plot --plot-type reads fast5/

3. Plot a histogram of read sizes from a set of FAST5 files.

.. code-block:: bash

    poretools hist fast5/
    poretools hist --min-length 1000 --max-length 10000 fast5/
